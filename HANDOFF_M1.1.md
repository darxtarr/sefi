# Sefi: M1.1 Complete → M1.2 Next

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Milestone**: M1.1 ✅ Complete | M1.2 Ready to Build
**Context Budget**: Started fresh at M1.1, stay under 100K tokens (loony territory beyond that)

---

## What M1.1 Accomplished

### Core Implementation ✅

**1. Mock Embedding Service** (`src/embed/mod.rs`)
- SHA256-based deterministic 768d vectors
- Unit normalized (L2 norm = 1)
- Deterministic: same text → same vector
- Cosine similarity helper function
- **Tests**: 3 passing (determinism, normalization, similarity)

**2. Streaming Cluster Engine** (`src/clustering/mod.rs`)
- Naive cosine threshold grouping (threshold = 0.75)
- Two-tempo decay: Fast (τ=2s) vs Slow (τ=30s)
- Cluster tracking with persistence counters
- Mature cluster detection (min_persistence=2, min_members=2)
- **Tests**: 7 passing (creation, decay, medoid, cohesion)

**3. Medoid Computation**
- Real concept anchors (not phantom centroids)
- Medoid = member with minimum sum of distances to all others
- Ensures clusters are anchored to actual semantic concepts

**4. Cohesion Metric**
- Average pairwise cosine similarity within cluster
- Range: [0, 1] where 1 = perfect cohesion
- Used for cluster quality validation

**5. Dependencies Added**
- `sha2 = "0.10"` - for hash-based embeddings
- `uuid = "1.0"` - for ID generation

### Test Status ✅

```bash
cargo test
# 10 tests passing, 0 failures
# - 3 embedding tests
# - 7 clustering tests (including decay behavior)

cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
# Zero warnings
```

### What M1.1 Proved

✅ The semantic sieve pipeline works end-to-end
✅ Two-tempo decay is tractable and testable
✅ Medoids + cohesion give us real semantic anchors
✅ Foundation is clean and extensible

## Current Architecture

### Data Flow (M1.1)

```
ConceptPacket (phrase)
  → EmbedService::embed()
  → 768d vector
  → Ledger::append()
  → ClusterEngine::tick()
  → Cluster detection (naive cosine threshold)
  → Two-tempo decay applied
  → Mature clusters identified
  → Medoid + Cohesion computed
```

### Key Files

**Already Built (Don't Touch Unless Bug):**
```
src/types.rs           # All schemas (Tempo, ConceptPacket, BasinFeedback, etc.)
src/ledger/store.rs    # In-memory ledger with time window queries
src/embed/mod.rs       # Mock embedding service (M1.1 ✅)
src/clustering/mod.rs  # Cluster engine with decay (M1.1 ✅)
src/bin/sefi.rs        # CLI stub (not wired to engine yet)
Cargo.toml             # Dependencies set
```

**To Build Next (M1.2):**
```
src/clustering/mod.rs  # UPGRADE: naive threshold → DBSCAN-lite
src/validator/mod.rs   # Basin validator wrapper (uses existing medoid/cohesion)
```

## What M1.2 Needs (Next Session)

### Goal: Upgrade to Streaming DBSCAN-lite

**Problem with M1.1:**
- Single global cosine threshold (0.75) is arbitrary
- Can't distinguish dense clusters from sparse noise
- No concept of core vs border vs noise points

**M1.2 Solution:**
- Epsilon neighborhoods (use existing cosine similarity)
- Min points threshold (configurable, e.g., 3)
- Core/border/noise classification:
  - **Core**: point with ≥ min_points neighbors within epsilon
  - **Border**: in neighborhood of core point, but not core itself
  - **Noise**: neither core nor border

### Implementation Strategy

**What's Already There:**
- ✅ `cosine_similarity()` function (can be used for epsilon neighborhoods)
- ✅ `Cluster` struct with members tracking
- ✅ `compute_medoid()` and `compute_cohesion()` (reuse as-is)

**What to Add:**

1. **DBSCAN parameters** in `ClusterEngine`:
   ```rust
   pub struct ClusterEngine {
       // ... existing fields ...
       epsilon: f32,      // e.g., 0.25 (distance threshold)
       min_points: usize, // e.g., 3 (min neighbors for core)
   }
   ```

2. **Point classification**:
   ```rust
   enum PointType {
       Core,
       Border,
       Noise,
   }

   fn classify_point(entry: &LedgerEntry, all_entries: &[&LedgerEntry]) -> PointType {
       // Count neighbors within epsilon
       // If count >= min_points → Core
       // Else if any neighbor is Core → Border
       // Else → Noise
   }
   ```

3. **Cluster expansion** (DBSCAN algorithm):
   - Start from unvisited core point
   - Expand cluster to include all density-reachable points
   - Border points join cluster but don't expand it
   - Noise points are ignored (or tracked separately)

4. **Update `tick()` method**:
   - Replace naive threshold grouping with DBSCAN expansion
   - Keep existing decay logic (works great!)
   - Keep existing mature cluster detection

### Tests to Add (M1.2)

```rust
#[test]
fn test_dbscan_finds_dense_clusters() {
    // Create tight cluster of 5 similar points
    // Create 2 isolated noise points
    // Verify: 1 cluster found, 2 noise points ignored
}

#[test]
fn test_core_vs_border_classification() {
    // Create cluster with clear core and border
    // Verify point classification
}

#[test]
fn test_epsilon_sensitivity() {
    // Same data, different epsilon values
    // Verify cluster count changes appropriately
}
```

## Design Decisions Made (Context for M1.2+)

### Why Medoids Instead of Centroids?

**Decision**: Use medoids (real concepts) not centroids (averaged vectors)

**Reason**: In semantic space, the centroid of "memory safety" + "borrow checker" might be a nonsense vector that doesn't correspond to any real concept. Medoid ensures we anchor to an actual phrase.

**Impact**: When we emit BasinFeedback in M1.3, the `rep_phrase` will always be a real contributor phrase, not gibberish.

### Why Two-Tempo Decay?

**Decision**: Fast (τ=2s) vs Slow (τ=30s) vs Urgent (bypass)

**Reason**:
- **Fast**: Bursts, alerts, rapid iterations (decay quickly)
- **Slow**: Consensus, persistent thoughts (decay slowly)
- **Urgent**: Immediate action, bypass persistence checks

**Impact**: Allows same clustering engine to handle different signal types without separate pipelines.

### Why Naive Threshold First (M1.1)?

**Decision**: Start with simple cosine threshold before DBSCAN

**Reason**:
- Prove pipeline works end-to-end
- Test decay + medoid + cohesion independently
- DBSCAN adds complexity; validate foundation first

**Impact**: M1.2 can now safely upgrade to DBSCAN knowing the plumbing works.

## Hooks Already in Place (For Future Milestones)

### M1.3 (PreCards + BasinFeedback)
- `Cluster.medoid_phrase` → ready for PreCard summary
- `Cluster.members` → ready for top-k phrase extraction
- `compute_cohesion()` → ready for BasinFeedback metadata

### M1.4+ (Flow Layer)
- `Cluster.persistence` → ready for flow intensity tracking
- `Tempo` enum → extensible for governor logic
- `LedgerEntry.timestamp` → ready for time-series analysis

### Beyond (Predictive Governor)
- Medoids → semantic anchors for trust currency (C_A)
- Cohesion → cluster quality metric for escalation decisions
- Decay → foundation for dynamic stability tracking

---

## Critical Context (Don't Skip This)

### The Bigger Picture

**Static Layer (M1.1-M1.2)**: Clustering with decay
- What you just built: semantic sieve that finds persistent patterns

**Dynamic Layer (Future)**: Flow tracking
- On top of clustering: track how clusters form, merge, split over time

**Predictive Layer (Future)**: Governor with trust currency
- On top of flow: decide when to escalate based on stability + cohesion + persistence

**Why M1.2 Matters:**
- DBSCAN-lite turns arbitrary thresholds into real density-based basins
- These basins become the foundation for flow dynamics
- Flow dynamics become the input to the governor
- **If M1.2 clustering is wrong, everything above collapses**

### Boutique Philosophy Reminder

- **Understand every line**: No magic, no frameworks
- **Test-first**: Write tests before implementation
- **Minimal deps**: Only add crates when absolutely necessary
- **Clean commits**: One feature per commit, descriptive messages

---

## Quick Start (Next Session)

### 1. Read This File First
You're reading it now. Good.

### 2. Review Existing Code
```bash
# Check what's already there
cat src/clustering/mod.rs  # Your foundation
cat src/embed/mod.rs       # Mock embeddings
cat src/types.rs           # All schemas

# Run tests to verify everything works
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### 3. Start M1.2 Implementation

**Step 1**: Add DBSCAN parameters to `ClusterEngine`
**Step 2**: Write tests for point classification (core/border/noise)
**Step 3**: Implement `classify_point()` helper
**Step 4**: Implement DBSCAN cluster expansion
**Step 5**: Update `tick()` to use DBSCAN instead of naive threshold
**Step 6**: Run tests, fix, iterate
**Step 7**: Commit & push

### 4. Success Criteria

✅ DBSCAN correctly identifies dense clusters
✅ Noise points are filtered out
✅ All existing tests still pass
✅ New DBSCAN tests pass
✅ Zero clippy warnings
✅ Medoid + cohesion still work (they should, you're just changing cluster detection)

---

## Common Pitfalls (Learn from M1.1)

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Change existing APIs**: Ledger, EmbedService, types.rs are DONE. Don't touch.
2. **Add unnecessary crates**: We don't need `hnsw` yet (wait for Phase 2).
3. **Skip tests**: You'll regret it. Write tests FIRST.
4. **Batch commits**: One feature = one commit. Makes debugging easier.

### ✅ Do This:

1. **Reuse existing helpers**: `cosine_similarity()`, `compute_medoid()`, `compute_cohesion()`
2. **Keep decay logic**: It works. Don't change it.
3. **Test edge cases**: Empty ledger, single point, all noise, etc.
4. **Ask questions**: Use QUESTIONS.md to document design uncertainties

**Removed**:
- `HANDOFF.md` (obsolete from previous session)
- `HANDOVER.md` (obsolete from previous session)
