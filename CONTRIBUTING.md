# Contributing to Sefi

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ â€” if you're reading this, you're part of the experiment.

Sefi is not "just another library." It's a **semantic governor**: a system that filters floods of agent emissions into a handful of actionable signals. Because it's experimental, your role isn't only to add code â€” it's to **challenge the design**.

## What We Value

### Critical probing over passive implementation
If something feels unclear, backwards, or overcomplicated â€” say so.
Your questions are as valuable as your pull requests.

### Clarity over cleverness
Every line should be understandable. Boutique philosophy: if we don't know what it does, it doesn't belong.

### Iteration over completion
Expect the architecture to evolve. We prefer tight loops of feedback to over-specified blueprints.

## How to Contribute

1. **Read the README** â€” that's the north star. Don't assume the details are final.

2. **Ask first** â€” open an issue or comment to probe assumptions.

3. **PRs welcome** â€” but small, clean, self-explanatory changes.

4. **Tests are mandatory** â€” TDD is our safety net. Every new component should ship with its own checks.

5. **Language matters** â€” be precise in code and in docs. If a metaphor (valley, ridge, peak) confuses, propose a better one.

## Things We Expect You To Ask

- What concrete problem does this solve?
- Why this algorithm, not something simpler?
- How does feedback actually get consumed?
- What happens when thresholds are wrong?
- Is this efficient at scale, or just pretty in theory?

If you don't find yourself asking at least one of these, you may not be looking closely enough.

## Bottom Line

This is not a finished product â€” it's a **living lab**.

Your job is to question, refine, and stress-test the design.

If all you do is implement, you're missing half the fun.
